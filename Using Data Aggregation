#List comprehensions provide a concise way to create new lists based on existing iterables.
#You can integrate data aggregation functions like sum(), min(), and max() directly within list comprehensions to perform calculations on the elements of the new list as it's being created.

#Calculating the Sum of Squares:
#numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#sum_of_squares = sum([n * n for n in numbers])
#print(sum_of_squares)
## Output: 55
#In this example, the list comprehension [n * n for n in numbers] creates a list of squares, and the sum() function calculates the sum of these squares.
#Finding the Minimum of Transformed Values:
#numbers = [-3, -1, 0, 1, 3]
#min_absolute = min([abs(n) for n in numbers])
#obs : abs() é uma função que serve para n coisas veja no site : https://programadorviking.com.br/abs-python/ e https://medium.com/@wassuncaon/guia-completo-para-entender-e-usar-a-fun%C3%A7%C3%A3o-abs-no-python-1d428ea2c4f8
#print(min_absolute)
## Output: 0
#Here, the list comprehension [abs(n) for n in numbers] creates a list of absolute values, and the min() function finds the minimum value in this list.
#Finding the Maximum of Filtered Values:
#numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
#max_even = max([n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0])
#print(max_even)
## Output: 6
#In this example, the list comprehension [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0] creates a list of even numbers, and the max() function finds the maximum value in this list.

#Challenge

Easy
Write a function sum_positive_evens that takes a list of numbers as input. Use a list comprehension to filter positive even numbers, then use sum() to calculate their total. Return the result.

Example input:

numbers = [-10, -5, 0, 2, 4, 7, 10, 12]
Example output:

28

# minha resolução : 
def sum_positive_evens(numbers):
    sum_list_numbers =sum([numb for numb in numbers if numb > 0  if numb % 2 == 0 ])
    return sum_list_numbers
