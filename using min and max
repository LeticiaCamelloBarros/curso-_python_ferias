# Finding Minimum and Maximum
# Python offers built-in functions to find the minimum and maximum values in a collection of data, such as a list or a tuple. These functions, min() and max(), are straightforward to use and can be applied to various data types, including numbers and strings.
# Finding the Minimum Value:
# numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]
# smallest = min(numbers)
# print(smallest)
# # Output: 1
# In this example, the min() function finds the smallest number in the numbers list.
# Finding the Maximum Value:
# numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]
# largest = max(numbers)
# print(largest)
# # Output: 9
# Here, the max() function finds the largest number in the numbers list.
# Working with Strings:
# The min() and max() functions can also be used with strings. In this case, they compare the strings based on their lexicographical order (i.e., the order they would appear in a dictionary).
# words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# smallest_word = min(words)
# largest_word = max(words)
# print(smallest_word)
# Output: apple
# print(largest_word)
# # Output: cherry
# In this example, min() returns "apple" because it comes first alphabetically, and max() returns "cherry" because it comes last alphabetically.

#problem : 
You are given a list of numbers and a list of words. Your task is to write a program that:
Finds and prints the smallest and largest number in the list of numbers using min() and max().
Finds and prints the smallest and largest word in

#solution
numbers = [42, 17, 23, 56, 9, 34]
words = ["kiwi", "apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
print(f"Smallest number: {min(numbers)}")
print(f"Largest number: {max(numbers)}")
print(f"Smallest word: {min(words)}")
print(f"Largest word: {max(words)}")
