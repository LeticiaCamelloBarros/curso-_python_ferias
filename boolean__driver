# Write code that checks if a person is eligible to drive. A person is eligible to drive if ALL of the following conditions are met:

# The person is at least 18 years old
# The person has a license
# The person has insurance
# Your program should:
# Read an integer age from the first line of input
# Read a string has_license from the second line of input (either "true" or "false")
# Read a string has_insurance from the third line of input (either "true" or "false")
# Convert the license and insurance inputs to boolean values
# Check all three conditions and store the result in a variable named result
# Print the final result (should be True or False)


# quero imprimir True ou False
