"""Write a program that determines eligibility for a movie based on age and parental guidance.

Your program should:

Create a variable age and assign it a value from input (given).
Create a variable with_parent and assign it a True/False value from input (given).
Create a variable named message with the value of "None" (given).
Use nested if-else to determine what string to put in message: 
If age is 18 or older, set "You can watch any movie".
If age is under 18: 
If with_parent is True, set "You can watch PG-13 movies".
If with_parent is False, set "You can only watch G-rated movies"""

# Get age as an integer
age = int(input())
# Declare a variable named message with "None"
message = "None"
# Get parental guidance as a boolean (True/False)
with_parent = input().lower()
# Write your nested if-else code here
if age < 18 : 
    if with_parent.lower() == "true":
        message = "You can watch PG-13 movies"
    elif with_parent.lower() == "false":
        message = "You can only watch G-rated movies"
elif age >= 18 :
        message = "You can watch any movie"
# Don't change below this line
print(message)
