#Project Overview:
#The Student Records Manager manages student data using dictionaries and sets. 
#Each student record includes their name, age, grades, and courses.
#Key operations include adding students, updating grades, checking course enrollment, calculating average grades, listing students by course, and filtering top students based on grade thresholds.
#This project demonstrates the practical use of dictionaries for structured data, sets to handle duplicates, and advanced decision-making for efficient data management.
#It’s a practical way to apply Python concepts in a real-world scenario.
