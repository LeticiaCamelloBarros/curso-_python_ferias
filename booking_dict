"""In this project, we will build a Contact Book application step by step by breaking it into small, manageable functions. The first step is to create a display_menu function.

Create a function named display_menu that prints the main menu options for the Contact Book.

The menu should include the following options:

Add Contact
View Contact
Edit Contact
Delete Contact
List All Contacts
Exit
This function will be the starting point of the program, helping users navigate through the options.

Check the test case for the output format!"""

"""Now, create the add_contact function that takes one argument: contact_book (a dictionary). The function should:

Get input for the contact's name, phone, email, and address.
Check if the name already exists in the dictionary. If it does, print: "Contact already exists!".
If not, save the contact in the following format:

contact_book[name] = {
	"phone": phone,
	"email": email,
	"address": address
}
Then print: "Contact added successfully!"."""
